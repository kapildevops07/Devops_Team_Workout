================ Docker ================
Overview:
	- Develop, ship and run application
	- Docker seperates application from infrastructure
	- With docker, we manage infrastructure as we manage application
	- Reduce delay between writing a code and running it in production

1.a Docker Platform:
	- Docekr run application in isolated environment
		- Shipping application, you push the image to other environment (stage, production)
		- No applicaiton dependency on shipping your application

1.b What can i use Docker for:
	- Fast, Consistent delivery of application
	- Responsive development and Scaling 
		- Portable workloads -> Can run in local machine, VM, Cloud, data center
		- Dynamically manage workloads -> Scale up or tear down application on demand
	- Running more workloads on same hardware

1.3 Docker Architecture:
	- Client-Server architecture
	- Docker client and server can run in same machine or different machine
	- Docker client will communicate docker server in order to perform a task through Rest API over unix sockets
	- Behind the hood, it is Docker server who performs actual tasks. Server manages docker objects
	- Another docker client is Docker compose

Docker Editions:
	- Community Editions [Free]
		- Edge release
		- Stable release
	- Enterprise Editions [Paid]
		- Extended support	
		
Docker Installation:
	- Always use latest version of docker. Uninstall pre installer versions of docker	
		- The pre installed docker version will be out of date
	- Installation document URL: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
	- Installation Modes:
		- Setup registory
		- Install manually
		- Script
	 	
	- While installing install docker, docker-engine and docker-compose
	- Docker [For client], Docker-Engine[Server], docker-compose[CLI for docker compose]
	- Verify docker installation
		- docker version
		- docker info
	- Add user to docker group, because docker will run only on root user [In RHEL, even after adding user to docker group, one still need to use sudo command]
		- sudo usermod -a -G groupName userName
		
Container and Images:
	- Container: Running instance of an image
	- Image: A packaged binary that make an application
	- Container commands:
		- docker container run 
		- docker container ls
		- docker container start
		- docker container stop
		- docekr container inspect
		
	- Getting a shell inside a container
		- docker container run -it <image name>
			- This will create a new instance of a container and log us into the container directly
		- docker container exec it <existing container id>
			- This will log us into an existing instance of a running container
		
	- Network Commands:
		- docker network ls
		- docker network create --driver <driver name> <network name>
		- docker network connect <network ID> <container id>
		- docker network disconnect <network ID> <container id>
		
	- Images:
		- docker history <container name>
		- docker inspect <image name>
		- docker tag <old image/tag> <new image/tag>
		- docker login 
		- docker logout
		- docker push <image>
		- docker pull <image>
	
	- Volumes:
		- docker volume create 
		- use -v option while running a container

Docker File:
	- simple text file that contains the commands a user could call to assemble an image
	

- How images are layered




Container and Image:
		- Image
			- local
			- Hub
		- Pull image
		- Container run
	





Queries:

Docker overview:
	* How Virtual Box or VM Ware consumens memory from host machine? 
		- I have a machine with 16 Gb ram, If we allocate 4 Gb for a VM, Do th host have only 12 Gb for host machine to work. 
		- When this 4 Gb of memory will be consumed. Only when a VM is running or even at shut down state the reserved memory is not available for host machine
		- Even a container will consume memory, As container is small and has only essential component. Is this the reason that container consume less memory
		
	* How to configure docker to look for registry other than docker hub
	* what is containerd.io package installed while installing docker 
		- What is OCI "Open Container Initiative"
	* When and in what situation should we need to check image history
	* How to use keywhiz for passwords instead of storing them in env variables.
